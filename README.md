# tools-I-use
A mostly complete list of tools I use when working on projects and playing with code. 

I work on Mac. Not a fan of Windows but run away from any debate around the desktop OS. Choose the one you like, period!

- XMind - to document / analyze and track ideas, design, development
- yEd - to describe / document an architecture
- Balsamiq - to create mockups
- Trello - just a bit for now

- Sublime Text
- vi - yes, vi!
